## Key Features

**Mood-Based Recommendations**

The heart of the app: users select a mood (e.g., Happy, Sad, Inspired, Love, Thriller) and instantly receive tailored movie suggestions.

If an API key is provided, the app fetches real movie data from TMDb for each mood.

**Fallback Movie List**

In case the TMDb key isn’t configured, your app shows a built-in fallback list, so it remains functional offline or without API access.

**Watchlist with Persistence**

Users can add or remove movies to their personal Watchlist, which is saved using local storage so it persists across sessions.

**Visually Appealing UI**

Features like a modern landing page, custom animated cursor, responsive design, and mood icons make the interface polished and pleasant to use.

**Vanilla JavaScript Implementation**

The app uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no external frameworks—showing a lightweight and clean build.
